# Melanoma Detection and Tracking 
This project detects melanoma cells captured by a Prophesee neuromorphic camera using background subtraction and contour detection. A customized centroid tracking algorithm tracks detected cells, addressing key challenges in medical imaging, including cell splitting, disappearance and reappearance, and merging followed by later separation.
