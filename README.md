# Melanoma Detection and Tracking 
This project detects melanoma cells captured by a Prophesee neuromorphic camera using background subtraction and contour detection. A customized centroid tracking algorithm tracks detected cells, addressing key challenges in medical imaging, including cell splitting, disappearance and reappearance, and merging followed by later separation.

---

## Features  
- Detects melanoma cells in microscopy video frames  
- Tracks cell movement using a centroid tracking algorithm  
- Handles cell splitting, merging, and reappearance  
- Processes videos from a Prophesee neuromorphic camera  
- Generates an output video with detected cells and tracking IDs
